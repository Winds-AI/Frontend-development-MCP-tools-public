# Product Overview

## Browser Tools MCP Extension - Autonomous AI Frontend Development Platform

**Version**: 1.2.0  
**Purpose**: Enable autonomous AI-powered frontend development workflows by providing AI agents with real-time browser context and debugging capabilities.

### Core Mission
This project bridges the gap between AI coding assistants and the browser environment that frontend developers rely on. It provides AI agents with the same contextual information that human developers use - browser logs, network requests, screenshots, element inspection, and API responses.

### Key Value Proposition
- **Autonomous Operation**: AI agents can work for hours without manual intervention
- **Real-time Context**: Live browser state, network activity, and visual feedback
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with popular AI IDEs (Windsurf, Cursor, Cline, Zed)
- **Project-aware**: Configurable per-project settings for API endpoints, auth tokens, and storage paths

### Target Users
- Frontend developers using AI coding assistants
- Teams implementing autonomous development workflows  
- Developers working on complex web applications requiring browser context for debugging and development

### Use Cases
1. **API Integration**: Discover, test, and integrate APIs with real-time response validation
2. **UI Development**: Visual debugging with screenshots and CSS inspection
3. **Automated Testing**: Navigate between pages and capture visual states
4. **Debugging**: Access browser logs, network requests, and element properties
5. **Recursive UI Improvement**: Iterative screenshot-analyze-improve workflows
